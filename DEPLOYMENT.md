# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment Approach

## ‚úÖ Summary of Requirements and Decisions

- **Purpose**: Hosting a simple fullstack web app (frontend + backend in one container).
- **Container**: Single Flask-based container serving both frontend and backend over HTTP.
- **DNS**: Managed by **Route 53** for custom domain and integration with CloudFront.
- **SSL Termination**: Handled by **CloudFront**. The container only speaks HTTP.
- **ECS Launch Type**: EC2.
- **Load Balancer**: Not used (by design).
- **Autoscaling**: Not used (by design).
- **Public Access**: EC2 instance is in a **public subnet** with an **Elastic IP**. We are aware of the risk of bypassing CloudFront and accepts it.
- **S3 Usage**: Only used to store a `config.json` file for the backend.
- **ECR Usage**: Stores the Docker image for the ECS task.
- **IAM**: The recommended IAM roles and permissions.
- **Monitoring**: **CloudWatch** is included for logging and metrics.

## üß© Final AWS Architecture for Fullstack Web App (Single Container, No ALB, With CloudWatch)

### 1. DNS & Domain Management
- **Route 53**:
  - Manages DNS records for the custom domain (e.g., your-app.com)
  - Routes user traffic to CloudFront via ALIAS or A record

### 2. Networking
- **VPC** with:
  - **1 Public Subnet**
  - **Internet Gateway**
- **Security Group**:
  - Allow **HTTP (port 80)** from CloudFront (restricted by security group)
  - Allow **outbound HTTPS (port 443)** for ECR and S3 access

### 3. Content Delivery & SSL Termination
- **CloudFront**:
  - Handles **SSL termination**
  - Forwards requests to EC2‚Äôs **Elastic IP** over **HTTP**
  - Ensures end users only interact via **HTTPS**

### 4. Compute
- **ECS Cluster (EC2 launch type)**:
  - **EC2 instance** in public subnet
  - **ECS Task** running a **single Flask container**
  - **Elastic IP** attached to EC2

### 5. Storage
- **S3 Bucket**:
  - Stores only `config.json`
  - Accessed by Flask app via **S3 VPC Endpoint** (optional)

### 6. Container Registry
- **ECR**:
  - Stores Docker image
  - ECS pulls image using **ECS Task Execution Role**

### 7. IAM Roles
- **ECS Task Execution Role**:
  - Pull from ECR
  - Read `config.json` from S3
- **EC2 Instance Role**:
  - Write logs and metrics to **CloudWatch**

### 8. Monitoring
- **CloudWatch**:
  - Collects logs from EC2 and ECS tasks
  - Enables basic monitoring and alerting

### Key Features
- **Anonymous access:** The app is publicly accessible from all regions via CloudFront.
- **No NAT Gateway, ALB, or Autoscaling:** Simple, cost-effective architecture for small/medium workloads.
- **Public subnet:** EC2 instance is in a public subnet, but all traffic is routed through CloudFront for security and performance.

| CloudWatch       | Logs (1GB)           | ~$0.50                  | Scales with usage |
| **Total (est.)** |                      | **~$38**                | For low traffic |
